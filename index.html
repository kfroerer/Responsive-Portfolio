            <p>Spunky. Driven. Funny. A little obsessed with weight lifting. At times a bit too honest. Those are just
            some of the words I use when asked to describe myself. I love a good joke, soccer, classic novels, and 
            hiking, but my all-time favorite way to spend my time is making memories with my husband 
            and 3 kids (ages 7, 4, and 1).</p>
        
            <p>Professionally I started out as an educator, teaching at a rural elementary school in Northern Utah. 
            It was fulfilling, fun, and challenging.  I stopped teaching when my husband’s schooling took us overseas 
            to Israel for two years.  Upon return to the States I began my own health coaching business. I have loved 
            giving people the tools they need to successfully meet their goals. I’ve taken that passion and applied it
            to web development. Now I create the tools needed to help both businesses and individuals succeed.
